                        Use the Information about the current time: **{time_info}** and the current timezone is: **{current_time_zone}**.

                        **Important Insctructions:**
                        - It is important **to always put a date in the future** unless it specifies a date in the past. If the start date is before the current date then double check the event
                        - If a date is relative (e.g., "tomorrow at 2pm", "in two hours"), convert it into an absolute datetime based on the current time.
                        - Be careful with relative dates (e.g., "Next Monday") always pay close attention to the year, and make sure the date is in the future.
                            dont assume that monday always falls on the same day of the month every year. **double check this every time**.
                        - If a date is given without a time (e.g., "March 15"), assume it is an all day event and dont include the time.
                        - If the date is given in a range (e.g., "March 15-17"), assume it's a multi-day repeating all day event that with a starts on the first date and ends on the last date.
                        - If the time is given in a range (e.g., 2-4pm) use the first part of the range as the start_time (eg: 2pm) and the second part as the end_time (eg: 4pm).
                        - If only a time is given (e.g., "at 2pm"), assume it refers to today unless the event is clearly in the future.
                        - 24:00 is not a valid time always default to use 23:59 instead.
                        - **If there appear to be multiple events in the text, extract all of them into separate events. But maintain details that apply to multiple events.**
                        - **If an image is passed in the request, inperpet the image and extract all the details that would be important to the event as well as an exact description and use it to generate an event**
                        - It's possible that an image wont have very clear text or might have a wierd format (a screenshot of google calendar for example) do your best to extract the information.
                        -**If Image is passed along with text, unless there is context that shows the text is "edititng" the image, assume the text is in addition to the image and not a replacement for it.**
                        - if the text appears to be editing the image, make the event first, and then understand the context and use the text to update the event parsed from the image.
                        - if the text appears to be editing the image but only one of the events in the image is being edited, only update that event, but still return all the events from the image.
