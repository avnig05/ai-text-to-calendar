## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

Alternatively, for the backend requirements, run:

```bash
pip install -r ./src/backend/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, start the application locally by running:

```bash
bash runlocal.sh
```

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

`http://localhost:3000/`

This will allow you to interact with the event converter.

## Command-Line Interface

Calendarize also provides a CLI for generating calendar events. To test the CLI, navigate to the backend directory and run:

```bash
python -m event_generation.testing.test_to_cal_cli
```

### CLI Options

- **Image Input**:
  - Provide the path to an image file (e.g., `./src/backend/event_generation/testing/single_event.png`). In this mode, `image_parser.py` processes the image to extract text before invoking `text_parser.py`.

- **Text Input**:
  - Enter your event prompt directly. In this mode, `text_parser.py` is used to generate an `Event` object with all relevant details and links.

To generate an ICS file, modify the `genIcal` flag in `test_to_cal_cli.py` to `true`.

### Running the Application as a CLI

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the CLI. The CLI script outputs an `Event` object that includes all event details and calendar links, facilitating easy import into your preferred calendar application.

## Future Improvements

- Enable post-generation editing of events
- Integrate additional calendar services
- Enhance error handling and improve the user interface
